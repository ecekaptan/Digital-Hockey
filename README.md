# Air-Hockey Game

## Overview
This project implements a simple air-hockey game on an FPGA device for two players. The game utilizes LEDs to represent puck movement across a 5x5 playing field, and a seven-segment display (SSD) to show the puck's Y-coordinate and player scores. The game logic is implemented using Verilog.
